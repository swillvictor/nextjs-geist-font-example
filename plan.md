Below is a detailed plan outlining the changes and new files needed to enable a preview of your Next.js application.

---

### 1. Overview

Because the app is missing the critical Next.js App Router files (namely, the layout and page components), we will add two new files under the src/app folder:
- A root layout file (layout.tsx) that wraps the entire application and imports the global styles.
- A main page file (page.tsx) that renders a modern preview interface.

This plan assumes the rest of the codebase (e.g., UI components in src/components/ui and globals.css) is functioning as expected. Should further dependencies be required later, we will re-assess and re-plan.

---

### 2. File Changes & Additions

#### A. Create/Update: `src/app/layout.tsx`

- **Purpose:**  
  Provides the overall structure of the application. It wraps every page with HTML boilerplate and imports the global stylesheet.

- **Steps:**
  - Create a new file at `src/app/layout.tsx`.
  - Import `globals.css` to apply global CSS styles.
  - Define a functional component (`RootLayout`) that wraps its children with `<html>` and `<body>` tags.
  - Set essential meta tags (e.g., viewport) and a title for a better SEO and preview experience.
  - **Error Handling:** Wrap children in a fallback container (or eventually add an error boundary) if an error occurs during rendering.

- **Example Code:**
  ```typescript
  import './globals.css';

  export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
    return (
      <html lang="en">
        <head>
          <title>My App Preview</title>
          <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
        </head>
        <body className="bg-gray-50 text-gray-900">
          {children}
        </body>
      </html>
    );
  }
  ```

#### B. Create: `src/app/page.tsx`

- **Purpose:**  
  Provides the main preview page. This page acts as a landing page with a modern design that is both clean and stylistic.

- **Steps:**
  - Create a new file at `src/app/page.tsx`.
  - Design a centered preview “card” using Tailwind CSS for a modern look. This component should include:
    - A prominent header title (e.g., “Welcome to My App”).
    - A descriptive paragraph that explains the app’s features.
    - A styled button (e.g., “Get Started”) to mimic a call-to-action.
  - **UI/UX Considerations:**  
    - Use clean typography, balanced spacing, and a light background with subtle shadows.
    - Ensure responsiveness and accessibility (contrast, proper semantic tags, etc.).
  - **Error Handling:**  
    - If any dynamic data is to be fetched later, add try/catch blocks and fallback UI provisions.

- **Example Code:**
  ```typescript
  export default function HomePage() {
    return (
      <div className="min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center bg-gray-50">
        <div className="max-w-xl mx-auto p-8 bg-white shadow-md rounded-lg text-center">
          <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">Welcome to My App</h1>
          <p className="mb-6 text-lg text-gray-700">
            Experience the modern, fast, and intuitive design of our application.
            Navigate through simple, clean layouts that focus on usability and aesthetics.
          </p>
          <button className="px-6 py-3 bg-blue-600 text-white font-semibold rounded-md hover:bg-blue-700 transition">
            Get Started
          </button>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

### 3. Integration & Testing

- **Integration:**  
  By adding these two files, Next.js will automatically use the new layout and page as the entry point. Running `npm run dev` (as defined in package.json) will load this preview page at the root URL.

- **Testing:**  
  - Run the development server with `npm run dev` (on port 8000 based on your package.json script).
  - Manually verify that the preview page loads without errors.
  - Inspect the browser console for any warnings or errors and ensure the global styles are applied correctly.

---

### 4. Additional Considerations

- For future enhancements, consider integrating interactive UI components from the existing UI library (e.g., card, button, alert components) if you want to display dynamic content.
- Maintain best practices by using SemVer for future releases and ensuring that any new components have proper accessibility tags and testing.
- In case additional features or error boundaries need to be implemented, plan for their integration in the respective components.

---

### Summary

- Created a new `layout.tsx` file to provide a complete HTML structure and include global styles.
- Added a modern `page.tsx` as the preview page with a header, description, and call-to-action button.
- Adopted a clean, modern UI with Tailwind CSS classes, ensuring responsiveness and accessibility.
- Planned error handling strategies within the layout and page components.
- Integrated these files within the Next.js App Router for immediate preview via `npm run dev`.
- This plan covers all dependent files and sets the stage for future enhancements if needed.
